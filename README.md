# Customer Revenue Prediction Using Machine Learning

In this project, we developed a predictive model for customer transaction revenue using Google Analytics data from the Google Merchandise Store. We leveraged feature engineering and machine learning techniques to gain insights and improve revenue forecasting, all within AI4ALL's comprehensive AI4ALL Ignite accelerator program.

## Problem Statement 

Understanding and predicting customer revenue is essential for optimizing marketing strategies and resource allocation in e-commerce. With the vast and complex nature of web analytics data, effective revenue prediction can drive profitability and enhance the user experience, making this an impactful area of study.

## Key Results 

1. Achieved an RMSE of 1.58, improving predictive accuracy by 25% compared to the baseline RMSE of 2.11.
2. Identified key features that significantly influence revenue, such as page views, visit number, and traffic source.
3. Demonstrated the importance of feature engineering and data preprocessing in improving model performance and fairness.

## Methodologies 

We used Python and various machine learning libraries to clean and preprocess the data, extracting and flattening JSON fields for feature engineering. The XGBoost Regressor was chosen for its robustness in handling complex data patterns. The model was trained and evaluated using RMSE and RÂ² scores to ensure performance and interpretability, while data visualizations helped reveal relationships between features and revenue.
